# recommendation-systems

This project was caried out as part of Information Retrieval and Recommender Systems course in Tel-Aviv University.
We use u1.base and u1.test files from MovieLens dataset.

The project includes:
  1. Computing the similarity matrix of items using a varying similarity function (provided as a parameter), use cosine similarity as a        default parameter.
  2. Creating a rating prediction function - given as input a user, an item, and a parameter k, predict the rating that the user would          give to the item.
  3. Evaluating the system with different similarity matrices.
  3. Calculating directly the items ranking for each user.
